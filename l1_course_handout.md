# 50.043 Database Systems and Big Data  Course Handout

## This page will be updated regularly. Sync up often.

## Course Description

Database systems manage data which is at the heart of modern computing applications. This course covers the fundamentals of traditional databases, such as Oracle and MySQL, and core ideas of recent big data systems.

Students will learn important problems in data management that these systems are designed to solve. They will experience the internal design and implementation of relational databases. They will also understand the internals of state‐of‐the‐art big data platforms, namely Apache Spark, and use them on Amazon cloud (Amazon Web Service). The students will be able to determine the advantages and limitations of different database systems.
